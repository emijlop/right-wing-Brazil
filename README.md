# Right Wing Brazil
## Rise of right-wing politicians and social media in Brazil

### Introduction

In recent years, political campaigning and engagement have evolved to include higher reliance on social media platforms. In the case of Brazil, the rise of Jair Bolsonaro’s campaign was highly linked to the spread of outrage and hate speech on social media platforms to engage users. This exploratory report will examine the links between social media presence, popularity (measured through Wikipedia traffic), and political orientation (left, center, right), using politician’s data from the legislatoR package. We will explore how this relates to the contemporary rise of right wing politicians in the case of Brazil.

To this end, this report breaks down the legislators by political orientation (left, center, right) and inspects their overall social media use. It further explores the correlation between social media accounts and popularity (Wikipedia traffic). Special attention is given to the 20 most popular Brazilian legislators, as they are the most dominant in the political sphere. We will be looking at their share of Wikipedia traffic and how it has progressed over time from 2019 to 2023.
